First off, I want to extend a hearty congratulations to the graduating class of 2020\! I’m the parent of a graduating high schooler myself, so I know they all worked very hard despite their whole school year being flipped upside down.&nbsp;

With that being said, let’s dive into the latest news from our housing market—something many assumed would also be flipped upside down.&nbsp;

Right now, **we’re able to show houses, but we can’t overlap showings;** buyers are working with a 20- to 30-minute window to get in, check out the home, and get out. At the max, only four people are allowed into a home at one time, all of whom must obey social distancing guidelines while inside. Everyone is required to wear masks and gloves, and touching is kept to an absolute minimum.&nbsp;

Oftentimes, I’ll go in before a scheduled showing time to open up all interior doors and turn on lights throughout the home so that switches and knobs don’t have to be touched by several other people.&nbsp;

**Now is a good time to make a move on the market.** On the buying side, interest rates are incredibly low—we’re talking a *60-year* low. Right now, a 30-year fixed mortgage is anywhere from 3.25% to 3.75%, whereas a 15-year mortgage hovers around 3.25% and 3.5%. Buyers, if you want to get the most house for your buck, now’s the time to pull the trigger.&nbsp;

On the selling side, homes have been fetching multiple offers, even throughout the stay-at-home orders. Now, we’re seeing homes sell for $10,000 over asking price—even $25,000 over—and do so within a matter of days. Truly, there’s no better time to put your house on the market than right now.&nbsp;

In just the last two weeks since we’ve been deemed essential and allowed to get out and show houses, **we put 246 homes on the market and 130 have closed.&nbsp;**

If you’ve been thinking about selling or want a free market analysis where I’ll outline the do’s and don’ts of the selling process, give me a call or send an email. I’m always here to be a resource for you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
