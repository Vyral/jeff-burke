I’ve been selling real estate for almost 25 years, and nearly every year I’m asked during the winter months whether it’s a good time to sell.&nbsp;

**My answer is always a resounding ‘yes.’** In the wintertime, inventory is extremely low since many people take their homes off of the market and wait to re-list in spring.&nbsp;

This means that, as a wintertime seller, you’ll have less to compete against. Whereas you’re likely to compete against 20 to 30 other home sellers if you wait until spring, selling now allows you cut that competition down to 5 or 10.&nbsp;

Another point to consider is that **wintertime buyers are the most serious**. The average buyer doesn’t prefer to look for homes during this time of year, so those who search now do so out of necessity. It could be a job transfer or dramatic life event compelling them to buy now.&nbsp;

At this very moment, there are many buyers still looking for homes to fit their needs, and yours could be the one they’re waiting for. Listing now could net you top dollar in the least amount of time.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in selling soon and want to put together a game plan for how to pull off a smooth home sale, give me a call. I’d love to review your particular situation and help you craft a pricing strategy.
