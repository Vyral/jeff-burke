If you’re planning on spending the fall and winter getting your home ready for the 2021 market, **there’s something you need to do right now: Take green photos.** What I’m referring to here is taking photos of your home’s exterior while it’s still green and beautiful outside. We want to showcase your great outdoor spaces and not have to take pictures in the middle of winter where things just don’t quite look as good. If you’re interested in getting green photos taken in the next month, I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about real estate, reach out via phone or email. I’d love to help you.
