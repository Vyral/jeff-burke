With such low inventory in our market, buyers are wondering whether they should go out and compete in this market or build a brand-new home. **If you’re leaning toward new construction, there are a few different areas you should know.**

In the Grand Ledge community, we have some fantastic, brand-new move-in ready homes under $240,000. Most of them will be finished by April or May. There is a 4-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom option as well as a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom split level option. We also have a couple of different options in Dewitt for under $250,000.

One of our builders has a move-in special. It’s a $99 deposit to hold it and $99 for closing costs. Your interest rates won’t be any higher with this option, either

If you’re interested in walking through one of these spec homes that we have available, feel free to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
