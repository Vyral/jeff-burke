What can you do today to prepare your home for sale after the COVID-19 lockdown ends?

First, **put your “buyer’s eyes” on.** What did you look at when you bought the home? The things you’d look for in your next home are the same things you need to improve about your current home. Try boosting its curb appeal by improving the landscaping, for example. Also, take care of any repairs that need to be made.

Next, **start decluttering.** You’re moving anyway, so start packing things into boxes and moving them into storage. This will really open up the home’s space, and from there, you can stage it. I’d be happy to schedule a Zoom session with you and provide some staging tips. As I always say, we don’t put a dime in unless you can get a quarter out.&nbsp;

If you want to put your home on the market now, the good news is that houses are still selling—we put 72 homes on the market in the week prior to the recording of this video, and 79 houses sold in that same time frame. There’s a large contingent of motivated buyers and sellers out there, and interest rates are still low, so you don’t have to wait to make your move.
