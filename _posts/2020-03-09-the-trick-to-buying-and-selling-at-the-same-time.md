What’s the best way to go about buying and selling a home at the same time?

{% include pullquote.html %}

I’ve found that most sellers will go out and try to find the perfect house before they even put their home on the market to sell. Once they find their dream home, they’ll put an offer on it, only to watch the deal fall apart because the purchase of the dream home is contingent on their current home’s sale. In our competitive market, there are plenty of buyers who aren’t making contingent offers, which bumps you out of the primary spot.&nbsp;

Here’s my advice to home sellers: **Let’s put your home on the market*****before *****you go house hunting.** If you put your current home under contract before you write an offer on a new home, you’ll be more competitive with other buyers, since your purchase is now contingent on the closing of your current home and not the sale of it. This constitutes less risk to you, and it allows you to find and lock in the home of your dreams within your preferred time frame.&nbsp;
