Even with the quarantine measures, real estate is still going strong. Of course, we have to do this a little differently in order to comply with social distancing, but real estate transactions are still being carried out.&nbsp;

So what does the real estate process look like nowadays?

We’ve now begun to do a lot more virtually. We’re doing **virtual buyer consultations** through Zoom, which allows us to take buyers through the process from beginning to end and to enter their home criteria into our database.

We’ve also been setting up **virtual walkthroughs** of homes. If we don’t have a virtual walkthrough ready for a particular home, we’ll schedule for the seller to record a video as they walk through the house and answer the buyer’s questions about the property. Even inspectors and appraisers are still able to go through houses.

On the selling side, we’ve been doing **virtual listing consultations**, where the seller will walk us through their property on Zoom. We can record that walkthrough and upload it to the MLS so that any buyer can access it if they’re interested in the house.

If you’re in the market to buy or sell and would like more information about how we’ve adapted the real estate process to the current climate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to walk you through the process so that you have a better idea of how your transaction will go.
